# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Websockets for Top.gg. This is an unoffical tool for Top.gg that allows you to interact with the Top.gg vote Webhooks with a Websocket.
This documentation will help you understand how to use this tool. 
For Bot Developers you can use our libraries to easily implement Websockets. For those who want to use the Websockets directly, we provide a detailed guide on how to use them. We also provide a comprehensive API for those who want to use the API directly.  
<br />

For Developers who are not sure what websockets are, your bot likely uses a websocket connection to work with Discord. You should notice some simularities to how you interact with Discord's websocket.

## For Developers Using Libraries

We currently support Javascript/Typescript and Python. Third party libraries may be avaiable, however they are not listed here.

### JavaScript Library  

Our JavaScript library is designed to provide a seamless integration with JavaScript and TypeScript projects. You can find the detailed documentation [here](/docs/javascript).

### Python Library

Our Python library provides a robust and easy-to-use interface for interacting with our platform. You can find the detailed documentation [here](/docs/python).

## For Direct Websockets/API Developers

If you prefer to use websockets or the API directly, or if you're planning to create a library for a different language, you can find the detailed documentation for our websockets and API below.

### Websockets

Websockets provide the main way events are sent to the bot. You can find the detailed documentation for websockets [here](/docs/websocket).

### API

The API is used to get up to date information of voters for your bot, and the entity itself. You can find the detailed documentation for our API [here](/docs/api).
