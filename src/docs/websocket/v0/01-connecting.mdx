# Connecting to the websocket server

When you connect to the websocket server the websocket server will instantly upgrade the request to a websocket connection. If your websocket Authorization header is invalid, the server will instantly close the connection with a 4007 status code.
This status code indicates that the client is not authorized to connect to the websocket server and should not attempt to reconnect.

## Connection URL
~~~
wss://api.websockets-topgg.com/v0/websocket
~~~

## Headers
When connecting a websocket you will need to provide headers:
| Parameter      | Optional       | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Authorization`       |   false | This is your token found in the dashboard. This is the same token you use for the REST API. |
| `name`                |   true  | this is the name of the websocket instance.                                       |
| `lastmessagetimestamp`|   true  | If your connection disconnected this is the timestamp of the last processed message, all messages after this timestamp will be sent after the ready message |
| `resume`              |   true  | This probably shouldnt be used, resume is presumed to be true when lastmessagetimestamp is provided                                       |

## Ready response
When your connection is successfully established, the server will send a `ready` event. This event will contain the following data:
<SyntaxHighlighter language={"json"} customStyle={{ borderRadius: "0.25rem" }}>
{`{
    "op": 3,
    "d": {
      name: string,
      connectionId: string,
      entityId: string,
    }
}`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>
When the ready event is received you should start receiving the other messages from the server.
