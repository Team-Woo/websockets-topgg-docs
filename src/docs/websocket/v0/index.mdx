# Websockets

Welcome to the websocket docs, websockets can be fairly complex. My goal when designing the websocket infrastructure was to make it as simple as I possibly could.
On this page we will cover the basics of our websockets. 


## Messages
Our messages are quite simple. All messages will have the same basic data structure.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="json" customStyle={{ borderRadius: "0.25rem" }}>
{`{
    "op": number,
    "d": Object,
    "ts?": String
}
`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>


### Opcodes
| Name | Number |
|------|-------|
| Ready |  3 |
| Vote |  10 |
| Test | 11   |
| Reminder | 12 |


### Data
Data is always an object, the data will depend on the opcode. The data will be described in the specific opcode documentation.


### Timestamp
The timestamp is only provided on specific Opcodes. Vote, Test, and Reminder Opcodes will have a timestamp. The timestamp is the time the message was sent. This is used for getting all missed events while your connection was down.
